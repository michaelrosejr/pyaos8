## Aruba AOS 8 Python REST Client
### pyaos8

A Python module for use with Aruba AOS 8 mobility masters and controllers. Its aim is to make life easier for people who are not primarily programmers, but need to interact with services in a programmatic manner (e.g. automation)



### Disclaimer

This module is incomplete. It does not have all the API calls available on Aruba mobility masters and controllers. If you see something you need from the swagger client, let us know and we'll do our best to add it to this module. Even better, add it yourself and we'll help you merge your code in this repository.

This is not an 'official' SDK and is not guaranteed to always work with Aruba mobility masters and controller APIs, on all platforms, or without eating up all your machine's resources. But we'll do our best to keep it in good shape, are happy to take suggestions for improvements, and are open to collaborations. License info is [here](LICENSE.md).
